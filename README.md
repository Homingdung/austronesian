## Quantatitive analysis of linguistics

**Background enhancement**

*From Species To Languages: A phylogenetic approach to human prehistory*:

Methodology:
Basically，the main methodology in this article is analogy between biology and linguistics,  (i.e. Languages could be viewed as species, words could be viewed as genes, and historical linguists share highly common with evolutionary biologists),  and many evidence and examples suggest that approaches or techniques in biology could be applied to linguistics. 
 
Since the traditional methods such as glottochronological, lexicostatistics got so much criticisms, new approaches in biology tends to solve the problems caused by unreasonable assumptions or inaccuracy:
1. Binary Matrices to overcome information loss.
2. Likelihood Models to overcome inaccurate tree-building methods
3. Network Methods to overcome borrowing
4. Rate smoothing and estimating dates to overcoming rate variation through time
Plenty of advanced algorithm or approaches such as stochastic process model,  Markov chain Monte Carlo , MCMC algorithms ,Bayesian inference, GTR+CP substitution model, coalescent model are spread through this article.
 
This article is very good try for the combination of linguistics and Artificial Intelligence since the approaches cited in this article are mostly belonging to the area of Machine learning, In our study, methodology such as Bayesian inference, stochastic process, advanced classification could be used. Just as I mentioned before, AI techniques could also be applied to linguistics (i.e patterns like Decision tree, network classification, Naive Bayes Classifier).


## Austronesian
Austronesian, which is widely spoken in Pacific and Indian Oceans islands, Seafaring helped its spread.
There are a lot of linguistic database for this language.

Several methods have been used compare the effects. The almost same result could be achieved. In addition, some more analysis elements can be introduced. Numbers are very important. Similarly, domesticated crops, water, forests, etc. are also important elements. This is a common environmental feature faced by ancient humans.

Japanese is now regarded as a special case of Altaic by most scholars. People tend to think that it is less related to Austronesian. However, existing results have a lot of uncertainty. 

## Similarity analysis
Different methods have been used, like Euclid distance, complete linkage, centroid method, centroid based on midpoint, ward method.
